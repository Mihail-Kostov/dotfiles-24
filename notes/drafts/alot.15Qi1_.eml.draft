Hello Jean, Jan,

It was so good to see you both and catch up. I hope, as spring arrives,
that your visits will be more frequent and we can share Patricia's
garden which she so enjoyed working in.

Thank you Jean for sharing your thought that I should purchase
Patricia's home. I had tossed the idea around but hadn't given it the
attention it deserved. Property has always been a scale of attachment
that I have never been drawn to -- probably, as much as anything, due to
the magnitude of the commitment it represents.

But after sitting with your words, I find myself opening to the idea.
Not only for what it symbolically represents but, perhaps even as
importantly, to be able to disperse the entirety of Patricia's estate to
her beneficiaries as soon as possible. Don will be 71 this year, Becci
and Sayoko I surmise not far behind, and Sairin and Chris have faced
their own health issues and know the uncertainties of life. Providing
them Patricia's gift as soon as possible feels like the best way to
honour her wishes and intent.

Cheryl and I met this afternoon as part of the ongoing probate process
with my accountant. She was wondering as well about my decision
concerning the house, how long I would stay. And was thrilled at the
possibility that her old home may remain so.

So that is on the table now. I still have to see how to make this work
and, at the moment, haven't a clue -- but I am confident my financial
advisor and accountants can figure out a way. So I have you to thank for
your gentle unsolicited reminder. Your "voice" is always welcome. As
Patricia always knew, I never take anything personally, so you are
always welcome to tell me what you think I need to hear.

Today closes a month of surprising activity. Always, it seems,
completing, or in Patricia's words, "making things better" -- little
projects I had started for her. Her computerized television system which
she used in her last months. The ultimate keyboard for her to type with
-- she, having worn off the keycaps of her laptop with her prolific
writing.

More sadly, as Jan knows, the beginning of March was when I gave
Patricia my great great grandmother's wedding ring. Time did not permit
us the completion of that symbolic act. But we always felt wed to each
other in the time that we had.

It is a teary road with my sweet.

Steven
