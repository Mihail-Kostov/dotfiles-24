[cedar waxwings](http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Cedar_Waxwing/id). 
Hundreds of them. I estimate 300 plus. All perched on the leafless 
branches of a neighour's tree. Soaking in the western rays of the sun. 
Then all taking flight to return and land on the tree ten or so minutes 
later. Time and time again.

Cedar waxwings. Spring!
