more of a journal test entry than news.. but switching from my trusty 
Bayer sensor Fuji X100 to the new Fuji X-trans sensor X100T is no small 
upgrade. As the numerous reviews on the net reveal, this new 
rangerfinder from Fuji is as refined as it gets.

It's my plan to start travelling and documenting once again -- after 
I get my computer upgrades and workflow sorted out for this new sensor. 
Already triple the number of megapixels I really need, this camera 
should serve me well for years to come.
