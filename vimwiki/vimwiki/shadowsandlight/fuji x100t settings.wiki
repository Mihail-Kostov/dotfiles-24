the Fuji X100T is a significantly different beast from its X100 
ancestor. 


It not only sports Fuji's X-Trans sensor versus the original Bayer 
sensor but has a completely re-engineered optical viewfinder system 
which has been augmented with a digital LED rangefinder overlay window. 
Add the **Q** menu system and a myriad number of enhancements and I need 
to read the manual on the camera.

Its pedigree is obvious but there are now many more ways of configuring 
its operation to make the instrument all that much quicker to use.

## function buttons

yes, plural. The X100T now sports 7 programmable function button 
shortcuts -- from an original one of -- into the menu system whose 
settings can be altered with the **Up**/**Down** menu ring pads or rotating the 
**command dial**..

| button            | function               |
| --                | --                     |
| fn                | dynamic range          |
| up (menu ring)    | focus area             |
| left (menu ring)  | focus area             |
| right (menu ring) | focus area             |
| down (menu ring)  | focus area             |
| delete            | macro                  |
| wifi              | neutral density filter |

[ljust]Pressing the **Menu OK** button or the **shutter** button (halfway), 
completes the selection. **Back** cancels the selection.

It seems like a waste to assign an extra 3 buttons to *focus area* but 
this provides a more intuitive use of the direction pad ring without 
need for repositioning the thumb. Besides, it simplifies function button 
memorization which is easily compensated for by the **Q** menu.

## q menu

allows for 16 quick menu selections from a 4x4 list which is navigated 
with the direction pads of the menu ring and set by rotating the **command 
dial**..

| q  |                |              |                 |                 |
| -- | --             | --           | --              | --              |
|    | custom setting | iso          | white balance   | noise reduction |
|    | flash mode     | flash^ +/-   | image quality   | image size      |
|    | photometry     | self timer   | highlight tone  | shadow tone     |
|    | face detect    | shutter type | film simulation | colour          |

[ljust]Pressing the **Menu OK** button or the **shutter** button 
(halfway), completes the selection. **Back** cancels the selection. 

## custom settings

between the function buttons and the **Q** menu, pretty much all the 
image settings one might adjust are at the finger tips, 
eliminating the need to drill down into the camera's menu system. 

Even use of the **Q** menu is significantly reduced with the number 
of custom settings that are available to configure all manner of 
shooting preferences. These settings have been lifted from [Clifton 
Beard's](http://cliftonbeard.zenfolio.com/blog/2014/12/fuji-x100t-user-opinion-custom-settings-q-menu) 
review of the X100T..

Other black and white *film simulations* are easily enough switched to 
from the **Q** menu when the need arises. Classic Chrome and monochrome 
are my mainstays which are quickly dialed in with a single right or left 
turn of the command dial.

maximum battery life, focus speed and operation, and unobtrusiveness..
