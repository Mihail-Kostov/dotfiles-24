[draft] I simply abandoned it all. The knowledge, teachers, 
teachings. Why? Because that entire lifetime of collecting knowledge, 
practices, techniques, experiences, countless books, was predicated on 
one thing: that someone knew better, had the key, would lead me to 
water. And that at any single moment in time, I would be miraculously 
aligned with the right master, right group, right thought, going the 
right way. And more incredulously, that they, he/she, it, could lead me 
to the truth.

What a fabulous story that is. Just align yourself with the right 
leader, finding a like minded group to go along with the ride is always 
a bonus, pay the entrance fee, and presto: you have just bettered your 
odds for salvation.

Well, you will tilt yourself in favour of the salvation story. But 
sadly, that will not lead you to the truth. You can find comfort in 
numbers. But the journey through the pathless land can only be 
traversed by you, step by step, without anotherâ€™s idea of where you 
ought to go. The idea that someone else can show you the way and it 
will be yours, is just another story. A story that will forever 
separate you from the truth.
