[draft] one of the lasting impressions the land imparted was the 
resiliancy of life. It persists despite of. It is the majesty of love.

And it is this way with all things. Amidst terrible drought, life resounded everywhere. Not as loudly as after nourishing rains, but everywhere nevertheless. In the tall Ponderosa pines, scrub oak, ants and geckos.

One just needs to look at our bodies to appreciate this. We have to work really hard to kill it! The level of abuse we heap upon it is not befitting the temple it is. We don't take out the trash but rather fill it. Yet the body faithfully serves us despite our neglect. Hobbled, it keeps on ticking!

It is a miracle.
