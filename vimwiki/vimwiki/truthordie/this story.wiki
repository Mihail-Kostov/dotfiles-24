is about the ending of it. The ending of all stories and the freedom 
that comes from it.

How do you know you are in the story? When there is resistance; when 
there is resistance to [[what is]]. Now, this resistance need not be the 
obvious railing against [[reality]]. It can also be the subtle 
attachment to the comfortable alignment of the story in which you seem 
to have everything -- but are consciously or unconsciously afraid to 
lose it.

The story is about [[control]]. When we are trying to exert our control 
over what is or keep our illusory sense of having it. Always, though, 
our stories are pre-occupied with control in the endless pursuit of 
permanence, immortality, health, material safety, all the things we 
think we want -- but they are the wants of the story.

What we long for, though, is [[home]]. We yearn for the connection we 
think we don't have, when, in fact, it is [[the story]] that separates 
us from that we seek.
