[draft] [let me explain][] myself. Most of us in the West spend our 
lives barricading ourselves against death. An inordinate amount of time, 
in fact, if one considers the lengths we go to, to accumulate what is 
considered an adequate nest egg. A whole life time is spent, in fear, of 
not having enough, with the latter years marked by trying to turn the 
clock back as our bodies remind us that we will never be 18 again.

Death awaits us all. It is a simple fact. The wheel of time does not 
stop for any of us. Having myself been caught in the doctrine of 
retirement preparation, realizing this, I consciously chose to prepare 
for life instead. To reverse the priorities, putting passion first and 
work second.

It may seem foolish and counter to accepted behavior. But life and 
health are uncertain. [Now][now] is the only time you have.
