Toltec wisdom from Don Miguel Ruiz

## be impeccable with your word

* Speak with integrity.
* Say only what you mean.

    _Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about 
    others; use the power of your word in the direction of truth and 
    love._

## don't take anything personally

* Nothing others do is because of you.
* What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream.

    _When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you 
    won't be the victim of needless suffering._

## don't make assumptions

* Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want.
* Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama.

    _With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your 
    life._

## always do your best

* Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse and regret.

    _Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be 
    different when you are healthy as opposed to sick._
