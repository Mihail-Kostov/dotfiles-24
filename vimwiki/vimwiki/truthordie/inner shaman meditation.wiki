> "Behind the heart, between the spine, imagine a tiny throne: the 
majestic throne belonging to a powerful enlightened Shaman. And on this 
throne, sits this powerful enlightened Shaman, who is silently imagining 
you! Who you are and what your life is. 
>
> "Imagine that he also imagines the rest of the world, the events, the 
people, all the things that affect you, and everyone else he is 
imagining: the minutiae of your lives. 
>
> "Imagine that he also imagines the moon, the sun, the solar system, 
the stars, the galaxy, the universe, and everything else beyond all 
that. 
>
> "Now imagine that this Shaman behind your heart, expands to fill your 
entire body. Now you look through the Shaman's eyes. Sense what he 
senses. Feel what he feels. Think what he thinks. 
>
> "You, as this Shaman, may decree all that you desire and wish ("I 
decree.."). Indeed, in the creation of all that is, you are already 
doing so."

As you do the exercise, consider who the Inner Shaman is. When you are 
done -- now or any time up to the end of the day -- "park" the Shaman 
back on his throne behind the heart.
