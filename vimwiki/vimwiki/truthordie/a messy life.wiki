[draft] was her badge of honour. It is what separated her from other 
seekers. She was open to the vagaries of life and it accelerated her 
growth. An underlying tone of superiority accompanied this belief. She 
had worked on herself and was more aware of others' "stuff".

From that place was the constant judgement of others and the 
reaffirmation of her own superiority and righteousness.

Respect (towards her) and integrity were her two obsessions. And yet, 
when her so called messy life challenged her, it became the excuse to 
become dismissive, to blame it for misfortune received and perpetrated 
by her. Her integrity and respect, which she saw ever lacking in others, 
were swept under "that's life". Her life trumped all. 

The cast of her shadow could not be seen.

Our stories are ever convincing. We believe them and play them out, 
unaware of the script we write. We see clearly the failings of others, 
failing to recognize our own [[reflection]]. Ours is the story of 
separation and the belief in it, that life is separate from us.

It is not. It is what we believe. Not who we are.
