after much trial and experimentation, this is the kimchi recipe Patricia 
and I have arrived at. It is vegetarian -- does not use fish sauce or 
dried shrimp but you may chose to do so. And it uses a dry brine method 
versus soaking the cabbage in salt water. Soaking in water is somewhat 
quicker -- and requires more salt.

Nappa cabbage is key to the recipe as is Korean red chili flakes. This 
recipe is by weight about equal measures of cabbage to paste which is 
particular to our preferences. You may adjust accordingly to suit yours 
-- traditionally, there is only about a cup or two of paste to the 
cabbage.

## ingredients

cabbage

{{{
> 3 to 5 lbs. Napa cabbage  
1 tbsp. kosher salt per pound of cabbage  
}}}

[ljust]paste

{{{
> 1  to  2 lbs. daikon radish   
4  to  5 tbsp. ginger -- chopped  
4  to  5 tbsp. garlic -- chopped  
1 tsp. sugar  
2 carrots  
2 (total) Granny Smith apple and/or Asian pear  
2 tbsp. water  
2 to 3 tbsp. Korean red chili flakes (no substitution) per pound of cabbage  
4 green onions  
}}}

## equipment

most any glass jars will suffice but wide-mouth jars make filling that 
much easier..

- wide-mouth mason jars, enough to store about 3 litres of kimchi  
- wide-mouth funnel  
- large non-corrosive bowls and strainer  
- large spoon or plastic/latex gloves for mixing the paste and kimchi  
- mandolin for slicing and julienne chopping 

## brining

an hour and a half to two hours dry brining.

{{{
> 3 to 5 lbs. Napa cabbage  
1 tbsp. kosher salt per pound of cabbage  
-- cut Napa cabbage cross section, 1" wide. A traditional cut is to quarter the cabbage lengthwise and cut into 2" pieces. There are all manner of ways.  
-- place into non-corrosive bowl and thoroughly distribute with the 
kosher salt  
-- cover cabbage with a pot cover or plate that fits within 
the bowl to provide some compression during brining    
-- let brine for 90 minutes or so, remixing the cabbage a few times early on
}}}

Dry, the cut Napa cabbage will fill a large bowl. Once the kosher salt 
is added and distributed, you will notice the volume begin to diminish 
immediately as you work the cabbage. When the brining has completed, it 
will be a fraction of its original volume with a substantial amount of 
liquid released.

## preparation

prepare the paste while you wait for the brining to complete. Then cover 
in a large bowl with plastic wrap while you wait for the brining to 
complete.

{{{
> 1  to  2 lbs. daikon radish  
4  to  5 tbsp. ginger  
4  to  5 tbsp. garlic  
1 tsp. sugar  
2 carrots  
2 (total) Granny Smith apple and/or Asian pear  
2 tbsp. water  
1 to 2 tbsp. Korean red chili flakes per pound of cabbage  
4 green onions  
-- peel and cut daikon radish into 2" to 3" long, eighth to quarter inch thick sticks  
-- finely chop ginger and garlic (store bought minced garlic may be sustituted)  
-- peel and thinly slice carrots into thin discs or julienne   
-- peel, core and julienne apples/asian pears   
-- trim green onions into 1" pieces  
-- using a large spoon (do not contact the chili flakes with your 
hands), mix all ingredients into a non-corrosive bowl until all 
ingredients are well distributed
}}}

I love spicy food but this recipe uses less Korean chili flakes than 
traditional recipes which use up to 5 tbsp or more per pound -- to 
accommodate my partner's and guest's needs. Adjust accordingly for your 
palate.

The daikon is course cut here to add more crunch and texture to the 
kimchi -- another deviation from traditional recipes. Doing the same 
with the carrots would have added even more texture. There is all manner 
of leeway for the preparation to adjust this and the kimchi's 
presentation.

Unique to this recipe is that by the time the cabbage has brined and 
shrunk, you will have roughly equal amounts of cabbage and paste. 
Traditional kimchi recipes use very little paste by volume.

## mixing

after the cabbage has brined, rinse and drain the cabbage three times 
under the tap. Simply fill the cabbage container with water and drain. 
Place the brined cabbage in a colander -- its volume will have reduced 
substantially from the brining -- and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes.

Afterwards, add the paste to the drained cabbage. Mix thoroughly with 
a large spoon (or protected hands!) until all the ingredients are well 
distributed.

At this point you can begin packing the kimchi into their jars. However, 
you can also let the freshly mixed kimchi sit for a couple hours or even 
over night, covered (heresy)! Place a pot cover or plate over the 
mixture -- to provide some compression -- and cover the bowl with 
plastic wrap. Kimchi ferments at room temperature and doing so will 
allow the mixture to soften so as to pack more easily into their jars. 
This depends a lot on the ingredients and how coarsely they are cut.

## fermenting

typically 3 days fermentation at room temperature.

If you are so inclined, you can boil water and sterilize your 
mason jars. 

Using a wide mouth funnel, add handfuls of kimchi to your mason jars. 
Tamp down the kimchi with a spoon and submerge the mixture under its 
liquid. Leave at least a one-inch head space in the jar to accommodate 
fermentation -- more headroom will require less attention (spillage) 
during the height of fermentation. 

Place the lids on the jars but do not tighten them. Loosen by a quarter 
to half turn. During fermentation, expanding gases (bubbles) may cause 
the liquid to rise above the lip. It's a good idea to place the jars in 
a large pan to capture any liquid that may overflow -- especially during 
summer when your kitchen may be warmer causing a more active 
fermentation.

Release the gases every day by poking a chop stick or knife into the 
mason jar along the walls of the jars. Depending on the rate of 
fermentation (room temperature, sugars), the gases may need to be 
released several times a day -- a visible rise of the liquid in the jars 
or overflow spillage will be your indicators. Tamp down the kimchi after 
releasing the gases to re-submerge the contents. Replace the lids as 
before -- loosely to allow the gases to escape.

Typically, after 3 full days of fermentation, the fermentation process 
will have subsided significantly -- almost seemingly arrested. Tighten 
the lids and place in your refrigerator.

Your kimchi is ready for eating!

## note

i am constantly adjusting this recipe depending on my mood and season. 
Texture, spicing, ingredients, taste.. The proportions given are simply 
guidelines and dependent on the size of the Nappa and daikon available 
at the market -- though, oddly, I seem to always make roughly the same 
amount of paste regardless of the size of nappa!

Changing up the cuts of ingredients varies its texture and taste. Minced 
garlic and ginger are more traditional -- I prefer ginger slivers and 
even slices, as well as sliced garlic. There is lots of leeway to 
experiment and make this your own recipe.
