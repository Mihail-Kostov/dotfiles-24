is remembering that everyone is always doing their best. How is it 
possible to do otherwise in the enactment of the story we believe we 
are? We play our character to perfection, even the imperfections and 
limitations we think we have. 

It is hard at times when one feels wronged or let down by someone, 
especially with those we love because our stories are personally vested 
in them. And it can be gut wrenching when incomprehensible calamity is 
inflicted by fellow man and we are faced with global human suffering. 
But at every moment and circumstance, it is the best that each 
individual's belief in their story allows. 

The do gooder, the heinous criminal: both are trapped in their stories' 
projection of what reality is, and they act accordingly, playing out 
their [[narrative]], unaware of the possibilities beyond the reach of 
their story. One story may be more socially acceptable than another, but 
they remain stories, stories grappling with reality -- stories which 
separate us from the truth. 

When we can remember that everyone is always doing their best, judgement 
and division cease, and the seed of understanding germinates. In 
understanding is inclusion. And when you include everything and 
everyone, you have and are love.
