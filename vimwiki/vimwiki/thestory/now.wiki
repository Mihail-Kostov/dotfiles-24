everything you have done, every choice, every turn, has led you to this 
now point.

Nothing holds you back, holds you to the story you believe you are, 
except the refusal to let go of the past. Who refuses? None other than 
the story itself – that finely crafted identity full of memories and 
imaginations given meaning by it.

These unquestioned memories bear the weight of knowledge. Have 
a continuity only we give to them – and do so, fiercely, to protect the 
idea they hold of us, without which, would leave us in a quandary as to 
who we are: that place we dare not look. And so, the idea takes hold 
– the story persists.

Without a past, you are free. Free to be the embodiment of your Spirit. 
Free to act without karmic bondage. Free to love.
