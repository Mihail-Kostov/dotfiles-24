the [[story]] is largely unformed when we enter the world, save for our 
genetic heritage and karmic veils which hint at the road ahead of us. 
As we navigate our lives, we shape and fine tune our identity: the suit 
we put on each morning when we waken, the persona we believe ourselves 
to be. Our projection.

We chisel and refine this story throughout our life, as a projection of 
who we think we are and ought to be. And that who, is shaped by the 
experiences and assault of othersâ€™ projections upon us, of who they 
think we are and how they want us to be and who they would deny us.

The story expands to meet the ever changing landscape of experience and 
expectation. But it is always inadequate because it is a projection of 
our accumulated history. Life eludes it because it is expansive and 
untethered. While our story remains limited and fabricated, anchored in 
the past, forever caught in the projection of becoming.

The journey described here is about liberation, the freedom that 
results when the story's hold is no longer, forever seeking or 
avoiding. Without a haunted past or a projected future, only the 
timeless remains.
