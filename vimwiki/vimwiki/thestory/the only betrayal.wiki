is the betrayal of thought. When we are wronged, disappointed, thrown 
into confusion by someone we trusted, all that, is merely the denial of 
[[what is]].  People are exactly as they are, and thinking that they 
should behave otherwise is our projection, our story in conflict with 
theirs.

Trusting people to behave exactly as they are, allows them to never 
fail. Only by insisting that they behave differently, have a different
story, do we create needless [[personal suffering]].
