does the story end? It begins with the acknowledgement of it.

Simply that the story exists, manifest as our thought of who we are. 
A parent. Wife or husband. A career. A nice or not so nice person. 
A seeker. A believer. Loner. Lover. Lacking. Having. Powerless. 
Powerful. All the facets of our being.

It starts with merely looking. Then seeing it for what it is, without 
resistance or judgement or assumption. It falls away of its own accord 
through inquiry.

When the weight of the story no longer is, you are free.
