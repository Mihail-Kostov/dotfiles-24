when the story no longer is, the most miraculous thing remains. No words 
can describe it because there is no longer any separation. Point of 
reference from which to make comparison. History or past to project 
forward.

It is strangeness. It is the wonder of wonders that there could ever 
have been a story to begin with. And this and the story itself are 
miracles.

It is not to deny the story. The infinite variety of them is a testament 
to the infinite creativity of mind. It is this which makes all things 
possible. Cities. Communities. Technology. Exploration. All the 
expressions we choose.

It is a miraculous thing. And it is a miraculous thing when it is not.
