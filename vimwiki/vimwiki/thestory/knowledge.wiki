we are trapped by the expanse of knowledge. By what we know and by 
what we do not know. No matter how much we armour ourselves with 
knowledge, it is always incomplete. And, therefore, cannot protect us. 
So we strive endlessly to accumulate more knowledge.

This is not to say that the quest for knowledge is pointless. All that 
we have created and reached in all our exploratory endeavours, is the 
culmination of that effort. Our capacity to understand the inner 
workings of the known universe as a creature born of it, is an amazing 
notion. It is [incomprehensible that we should 
comprehend](http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/471.html) this. It is 
a wonder.

But there is no peace in knowledge for complete knowledge is always 
beyond the reach of our intellect -- always leading to one more 
question. That is the conundrum of the mind.
