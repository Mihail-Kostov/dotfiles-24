the story is all the thoughts we have about ourselves.

It is the main character within the drama that is our life. A history. 
A movement. And most of all, something that is being written by us, in 
the enactment of our lives.

The word allows us to see ourselves as something beyond what we think 
we are. To entertain the notion that our thoughts about ourselves are 
as real as the character in a fiction that describes our life.
