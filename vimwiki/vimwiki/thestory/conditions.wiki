we constantly place subtle and gross conditions on reality. _I will love 
you if.. I will honour my word if.. I will be happy if.._

It is difficult to not have conditions. It is personal. It is what 
defines us, individually and collectively. They are our opinions of what 
reality should be.

But any condition we place upon reality -- our relationships, 
environment, co-workers, strangers, work.. reality -- can only lead to 
suffering. At best, temporarily satisfying illusion. Conditions 
immediately place a lens over our experience. And in doing so, creates 
separation. 
  
That is why love is unconditional. Ironically, that can most easily
be sensed when one is alone, free of the triggers that pull up the
narrative and all its demands.

When we react, negatively or positively, to a situation, that is the
story asserting itself with its conditions.

But it is possible to act differently -- to be the "joy" of Spirit that
comes from direct experience which has no condition to be met, only
revels at the infinite vastness of creation. It is a freedom that is
only possible when there are no conditions.

We look for this. Suffer its absence. Are that which is the
problem and the liberation. A breathing koan!
