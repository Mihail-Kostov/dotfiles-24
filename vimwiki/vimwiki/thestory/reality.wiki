is a reminder of who we are. It is the inward projected outwards. What 
we perceive to be separate from us, to be affecting us, is merely our 
opinion in opposition to it. 

How can this be so?

It is because we ourselves are conflicted. Conflicted by belief which 
shapes and contours experience but is never in communion with it. Belief 
demands that everything conform to it. The most fundamental belief being 
that of our story.

We cannot be objective about reality when we have opinions about it, and 
are vested in a particular outcome. Which is the conformity of our 
belief. The idea of who we are.

In that, there is no room for love. For love is without idea.
