our story seldom allows stillness. It is busy with its self 
construction. Our lives are filled with movement, our minds moving from 
one activity to the next. Seldom do we stop, sit under a tree, by the 
meadow or under the stars. The current of life draws us rapidly down 
stream as we fall under the wheel of time.

We often come to physical rest but seldom do we actually stop. Full 
stop: a mind at rest, without the incessant movement towards a planned 
future, todo lists, agendas, outcomes. We are caught in the net of 
time, ensnarled in time which we create.

When we stop, time ends. The story ends. And the infinite avails itself.
Continuity is the movement of the past to the future. It is a 
projection of the
past, [[inertia]].

Only by stopping can we be touched by the timeless and reside in the 
centre from which creation originates.
