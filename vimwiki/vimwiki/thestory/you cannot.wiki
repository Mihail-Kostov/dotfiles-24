stop thinking. This just invites the bear trap that the mind is. It is 
the knot that cannot untangle itself the harder it is pulled at.

But you can allow your thoughts and simply inquire into the truth or 
falseness of them. You will find that thoughts are simply that. 
Thoughts. And that only your unconscious belief in them and the 
assumption that they are true, gives them weight.

It is this unquestioned belief in the constant stream of our thoughts 
that is the story. A most incredible drama, novel, full of characters. 
But still, only thought.
