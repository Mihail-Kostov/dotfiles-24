to end the story is both the most simple and the most difficult thing to 
do. Because the ending of it is the thought of the story as well.

It is the conundrum which the mind faces because the story is about 
movement. Movement from one state to another. It is the story of our 
life and it is difficult to be otherwise because that is all we 
remember.

Only by choiceless seeing is it possible. Everything else strengthens 
the grip of identification, the idea of being this now, and that next. 
In an instant it is neither.

And the needless suffering of the story ends.
