my medicine box is comprised of homeopathics (shamanic elementals), 
breath/body (rebirthing, emotional body, myofascial tissue, energy) work 
and shamanism (feather work, tobacco, plant medicines, allies, 
ceremony).

Much of my work is done through dream time and simple consults -- over 
the phone or visiting. More formal sessions in the manner of table work 
and remote healing is available as required. Prayer and ceremony 
complete the commitment to Spirit.

The work is focused on the release of the personal narrative. The story 
we believe we are. Physical ailments and trauma are often the body's way 
of reminding us of the story we would hold on to, and of the 
[[suffering]] that ensues when we resist [[what is]].
