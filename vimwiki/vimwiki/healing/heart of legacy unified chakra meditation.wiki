Imagine a thick line of Light beginning at the Omega chakra (8" below 
your spine), extending upwards through your spine and on upwards into 
the upper part of the unified field. Ground into the vastness of your 
Spirit. Allow your Spirit to stabilize you. Run twelve lines of Light 
downward from the point of the Omega chakra, opening around your feet 
like a cone. You are not grounding into the Earth. You're stabilizing 
yourself across the parallel realities of the planetary holhttp://thedarnedestthing:8000/the%20darnedest%20thingogram.
