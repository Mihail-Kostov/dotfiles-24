the search field can be found at the top of every page to the right of 
the site name in a faint box outline with ellipsis (...) and can filter 
for any article containing the search criteria entered.

Search criteria may contain a list of one or more words of the form..

| expression | filter                              |
| --         | --                                  |
| word       | any article containing word         |
| prefix*    | any article containing partial word |
| +word      | article must contain word           |
| +prefix*   | article must contain partial word   |
| -word      | article must not contain word       |

Note the use of the asterisk (*), plus (+) and minus (-) symbols with 
the search expressions. When applied, there should be no spaces between 
the word and the symbol.

The search will yield a list of articles matching the criteria from any 
thread in chronological order, most recent first (unless the search 
criteria is too restrictive and nothing is found).

The search engine is very nimble and is a very effective way to navigate 
this site once one is familiar with the nature of its content. Failing 
that, pulling up the [[index]] or [[date]] page and using the browser's 
own text search capability on the page provides another means for 
searching on article titles.
