each thread -- the submenu titles below the [the darnedest thing][] -- 
has an [about][] link which describes the thread, its purpose and 
intent. It is the starting point. And, by design, easily overlooked so 
as not to get in the way on future visits. A catch-22.

The link is quite simple to identify as it is the first link on the page 
below the lead in content, titled "about". The main or home page has 
a [start here][welcome] link for a global overview.

The broad scope of this site invites clarification. And is an invitation 
to exploration -- from the metaphysical to art to technical. They are 
all linked, even if it is not obvious -- because their source is the 
same.

So, gloss over the "abouts" to get your bearings. Poke around the site. 
Your [comments][] are welcome. It is all about connection. Your feedback 
will ultimately be reflected on this site..
