today a moment of insanity struck and I ended up adding text searching to this
site. Tagging waits. It wasn't by design but I surprised myself how easily
I was able to implement it. I really need to stop! though, the search feature
will encourage me to document the technical side of things more thoroughly
going forward as it is so nimble.

Now for real, to get back to adding content so that search is meaningful for
the site. It's the darnedest..
