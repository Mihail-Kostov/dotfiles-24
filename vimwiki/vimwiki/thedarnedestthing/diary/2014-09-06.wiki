a year has passed. And I am back in the Townships, under the cover of 
early autumn rains.

It has been a year of changes and the movement of unexpected 
relationship. Not seeking any, it availed itself. Wonders never cease.

The luxury of time afforded changes to the operating environment -- 
switching window managers and the ensuant transition to alternate 
applications and utilities in the never ending pursuit of the ultimate 
configuration that fits my quirky needs and habits. At this resting 
place, there should now be time to bring my attention to this site's 
primary focus.
