dates. Dates. DATES: the articles'. They get updated a lot on this site 
because I tend to go back and correct/amend material that has been 
written in an attempt to keep the content current and, as best as I can, 
accurate. In a way, it is too easy to amend the content that feeds this 
site, causing the chronology of the web pages to get shuffled.

This pertains to the [[colophon]] mainly but I revise the prose a lot 
too. A long history with words, how they sound and look on paper (screen 
nowadays), elicits constant revision. In the quest to be clear, to 
communicate and touch. Something whose roots took hold back in the days 
of manual typewriters, black and red ribbon and white-out.

It's a bit of a dilemma. Retaining the original submission date 
guarantees chronological order. But using the last modification date 
tracks the currency of the content. The site favours the later.

Of course, the answer lies between: the 
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) application could be made to track 
both dates across multiple servers but that would be avoidance of the 
need at hand.. to set out what I intended to do so many years ago: 
write!

I've done enough tweaking and upgrades to the servers the past several 
months..
