it has been a month here in the Eastern Townships of Quebec near the 
Vermont border. Save for the occasional visitation and call, it has 
been a [[solo]] of sorts, sans any of the hardships -- but full of the
stillness.

What was originally thought to be time focused on the "content" for 
this site, turned out to being a project of tweaking and refining 
"[[the look]]". Functionality was added that typically would have been  
addressed down the road -- but as I continued to shake down the site, 
opening up the code to correct anomalies, future plans moved to the 
present.

No doubt, this is not the end -- is it ever? -- but, overall, the site 
now feels complete. The underlying power beneath its simplicity befits 
the subject matter. I like the metaphor.
