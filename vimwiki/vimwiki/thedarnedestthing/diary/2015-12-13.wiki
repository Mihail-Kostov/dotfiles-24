a subtle but significant change to this web site.

The [home](the darnedest thing) page now shows the most recent articles 
posted for the various topic threads which comprise this site. Dependent 
on publication date, not all topic threads will necessarily be 
represented by their latest journal entry. Regardless, this should now 
make the home page appear less stale dated.

Surprisingly, despite not having touched the web framework code for 
quite some time, these changes were simply and cleanly implemented with 
a dozen lines of Ruby code without too much head scratching. The 
original design continues to hold up well.

Originally cobbled together with html generating shell scripts in its 
earliest incarnations as that proof of concept, it morphed into a web 
framework whose underlying technology became a point of interest -- 
vimwiki with [sinatra](colophon) allowed content to be mapped and 
reviewed effortlessly in real time. 

Starting out initially as a resource for clients, it has grown to 
include a repository of the knowledge accrued during the creation of the 
site itself and then some -- the WWW being what it is as a meta library 
of itself. I like the metaphor.

There are still a number of posts to share regarding the tools used 
along the way to create all this. And broader horizons to return to. 
There is nothing being sold here. But if you find something of interest, 
be it metaphysical, technical or otherwise, wonderful.
