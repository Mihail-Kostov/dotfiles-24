deployment has become a project of its own -- got the vps server running the
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) application with a hasty
[Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main) proxy configuration (that still 
managed to
take more time than I anticipated). Sleep does wonders and the configuration is
what it should be in the morning -- clean and simple.

I thought the day would end with a clean up of the startup scripts, in
anticipation of rolling out future site enhancements. Then I discovered
[Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/) which simplified 
my
Nginx/Sinatra configuration further -- albeit with a complete rebuild of the
[Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main) server -- whilst adding some 
deployment
niceties (you have to be a dork..)
