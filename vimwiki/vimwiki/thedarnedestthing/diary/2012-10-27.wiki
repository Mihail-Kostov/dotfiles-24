version 2 of this site is almost ready for launch. What happened to version
1 and the prototype that was really ready to go in June? The whole exercise got
the better of me, as I rediscovered my coding chops and moved from the proof of
concept set of scripts to generate the html for this site, transcribed that
to ruby, then moved all that to [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).

All this might seem more than a little silly, considering the
current lack of content and the fact you would be hard pressed to discern any
visible differences from the original prototype -- the beauty of css -- though,
under the hood there are several architectural changes to the site.

What can I say? I did intend to eventually migrate from the simple static site
to 
a [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
design. I guess the eventuality became [[now]] as I got on a roll. The next
steps will likely explore the possibilities of site searching and tagging. But
really, for that to be meaningful, I need to start putting up some content..
