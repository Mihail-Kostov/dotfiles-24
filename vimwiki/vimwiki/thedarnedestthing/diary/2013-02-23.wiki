gah! it took long enough to kick start a return to getting some thoughts
down. It was all necessary, of course. Diversions into a new programming
language, [[Haskell]], entertained the mind with its possibilities. And
allowed me to reflect on the desolate winter landscape with its constant
movement. In the background, peace watched.

Separated from the world of high speed internet left time to fine tune
my primary writing tool, my little compact netbook (though I am musing
about replacing its hard drive with an SSD). For the cause, I finally
customized a distraction free editor so that it could function with my
window manager and tweaked it so it would function identically with my
main system at home. Save for the electronic display panel, I could be
typing on my old manual Olivetti typewriter.

I have a few more weeks of house and pet sitting here in rural Quebec.
I hope to finally get this site to a suitable level of content whereby
it will gain a life of its own.
