## initial virtualbox configuration

mac OSX can be run under virtualization software. It is somewhat 
involved and, unfortunately, limited in that, to date, no virtualbox 
guest addition has been developed to provide full OSX functionality 
(display and device management in particular) and provisions beyond a 
maximum of 2GB RAM and 1 CPU. It is unfortunate because I prefer (not 
surprisingly) OSX's BSD underpinnings to Windows. Alas, this suffices to 
allow checking this site under Safari without needing to fire up my mac.

| Parameter  | Setting         |
|------------|-----------------|
| Name       | Snow Leopard    |
| Space      | 20GB            |
| RAM        | 2048MB          |
| Video RAM  | 128MB           |
| Video      | 3D Acceleration |
| Audio      | HDA             |
| Boot Order | DVD, Hard Disk  |

Manually execute the following commands..

`vboxmanage modifyvm "Snow Leopard" --firmware efi64`
`vboxmanage setextradata "Snow Leopard" VBoxInternal2/EfiGopMode 4`

Add the SmcDeviceKey line below the EfiGopMode line created above to the 
~/VirtualBox VMS/Snow Leopard.vbox file..

`<ExtraDataItem name=="VBoxInternal2/EfiGopMode" value=="4"/>`
`<ExtraDataItem name=="VBoxInternal2/SmcDeviceKey"
value=="ourhardworkbythesewordsguardedpleasedontsteal(c)^$AppleComputerInc"/>`

## install osx

from install disk in DVD drive, select Disk Utilities and partition OSX 
disk.

Install OSX, then install from internet, colemak keyboard layout (and 
give your hands a break from QUERTY!) and OSX updates (saving your vbox 
image beforehand is not a bad idea either, in case Apple updates kill 
your fresh install).

## post install

to upgrade to 2 CPUs, delete the following kext (move into a deprecated 
folder) _after_ updating software and rebooting.

Note: you must restore this kext before any subsequent software updates 
because, if you forget, you will likely have to do a complete reinstall, 
making this a somewhat dubious enhancement..

`mkdir /System/Library/Extensions/deprecated`
`mv /System/Library/Extensions/AppleIntelCPUPowerManagement.kext /System/Library/Extensions/deprecated`

| Parameter | Setting |
|-----------|---------|
| CPUs      | 2       |

To upgrade the screen resolution to 1920x1200 (as close as I can get to 
my 2560x1600 capable monitor) execute..

`vboxmanage setextradata "Snow Leopard" VBoxInternal2/EfiGopMode 5`
