[ljust]a picture can be worth a thousand words. 
[keyboard-editor-layout.com](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) is 
used to realize the Planck layouts described [here][plancking].

## colemak dh

the default layout..

![Colemak DH](/images/keyboard_layout_colemak_dh.jpg)

[ljust]where my fingers rest most of the time. Thumbs operating the 
**Space**, **Backspace**, **Tab**, **Delete** and **Shift** (see 
*modifiers*) keys relieve the weak pinkies of their typical keyboard 
responsibilities and further allows design of keyboard layers with home 
row emphasis.

One slight nuance introduced and deviating from all Colemak variants is 
the relocation of the **Slash** key. In this case, swapping with the 
**Quote** -- the rationale being that **Quote** has a higher frequency 
of use.. Ever trying to minimize pinkie travel.

## modifiers

by programming [QMK](https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware) layer 
and modifier toggle key actions, the 40% layout of 48 keys looses little 
to conventional 104 key keyboards..

![Modifiers](/images/keyboard_layout_modifiers.jpg)

[ljust]while gaining significant ergonomic benefits by minimizing finger 
travel and providing left/right hand fingering symmetry. The latter 
cannot be over emphasized.

Duplicating the **Shift**, **Ctrl** and **GUI** modifiers for the left 
and right pinkies permits alternate modifier key combinations that are 
otherwise awkward on conventional keyboards with their confined bottom 
row assignment of the modifier keys.

The **Right** cursor key begs to have a function or layer attached to 
it. Perhaps a line drawing or special characters set.. It's usually the 
other way around with keyboards: being constrained in some sort of way.

## symbol layer

is defined with numbers on the QWERTY row, placing the numeric keys much 
closer than standard layouts, and the more frequently used **Shift** 
*numeric* symbols on the home row. Individual left and right thumb keys 
allow toggling the layer for either hand..

**Brace** and **Curly Bracket** pairs are also conveniently placed to 
allow finger rolling by locating the **F7** through **F12** keys along 
the sides of the keyboard. By utilizing the *tap key* feature of the QMK 
software, double tapping the *left* **Parenthesis**, **Brace** and 
**Curly Bracket** automatically complete the symbol pair!

## hexadecimal keypad

is toggled by holding down the **Equal** key of the 
[Colemak layer][plancked#colemak-dh], the only layer modifier not 
conveniently enabled by the thumbs (but it is easily depressed with the 
edge of the palm without moving the left hand from the home row)..

![Hexadecimal keypad](/images/keyboard_layout_hexadecimal_layer.jpg)

[ljust]Lefties can be easily accomodated by placing the navigation 
cluster under the left hand and relocating the activation key to the 
**Right** cursor key.

## navigation cluster

by using the thumbs to hold down the left **Tab** and right **Delete** 
keys of the [Colemak layer][plancked#colemak-dh] *together*, cursor 
controls are available when not utilizing my system wide Vim navigation 
cluster keys..

![Navigation keypad](/images/keyboard_layout_symbol_navigation_layer.jpg)

[ljust]This is a variant of the [GuiFn][poker 2#guifn] navigation 
cluster I programmed on layer 2 of the Poker 2 keyboard and found second 
nature to use. While both thumbs must be engaged to enable this layer on 
the Planck, the thumb keys are in a more natural location than the Poker 
2 **Fn** key which requires shifting the hand laterally one key to 
access the cluster.

Placing modifiers under the opposite hand home row provides convenient 
navigation key combinations. As occurs with layout usage, the 
[prior location][plancking#navigation-layer] of the **Backspace** and 
**Delete** keys under the right hand has been moved to the left -- for 
the symmetry, more ergonomic fingering assignment and functional cluster 
separation. The is the beauty of the Planck with its ease of programming 
and reflashing.

## plover steno
 
actually outputs [QWERTY][plancking#plover] (note the *number row* at 
the top and the *ZXCV row* on the modifier row) but the Plover steno 
software transposes the keyboard to..

![Plover steno](/images/keyboard_layout_plover.jpg)

[ljust]And, yes, there exists only a subset of the alphabet and those 
are duplicate letters you see for the right and left hands, as well. 
Thumbs rest on the vowels and fingers *between* the two alpha rows!
Welcome to the world of phonetic finger chord typing.

The **Exit** key restores to the default [Colemak 
keyboard][plancked#colemak-dh] layout.
