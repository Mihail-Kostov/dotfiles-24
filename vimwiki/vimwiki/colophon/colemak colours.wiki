after several months of using my Colemak Shift-DH layout, I have finally 
arrived at a tri-coloured keyboard layout which highlights the modifier, 
home row and function layer -- left number keypad and right navigation 
cluster (see [Colemak Shift-DH][colemak shift-dh] for the function 
layer layouts) -- key regions..

<code>^ ^ ^ ^ `~ ^ = <span class='brown'>1 2</span> 3 4 <span class='brown'>5 6</span> ^ ^ 7 8 <span class='brown'>9 0</span> [^ ^ ]</code>
<code>^ ^ ^ ^ <span class='blue'>Esc</span>^ ^ - <span class='brown'>Q W</span> F P B ^ ^ J L U <span class='brown'>Y ; '</span>^ ^ <span class='blue'>Del</span></code>
<code>^ ^ ^ ^  <span class='blue'>Tab</span>^ ^ / <span class='brown'>A R</span> S <span class='blue'>T</span> G ^ ^ M <span class='blue'>N</span> E <span class='brown'>I O</span>^ ^ <span class='blue'>Enter</span></code>
<code>^ ^ ^ ^ \^ ^ <span class='blue'>Shift</span> <span class='brown'>X V</span> D C Z ^ ^ K H , .^ ^ <span class='blue'>Shift</span></code>
<code><span class='blue'>Ctrl^ ^ Win^ ^ Alt^ ^ ^ </span> Space^ ^ ^  Backspace^ ^ <span class='blue'>Fn^ ^ Pn^ ^ Ctrl</span></code>

[ljust]It looks weird in coloured type but surprisingly works IMO with 
dark grey modifiers, light grey function layer and biege alpha keycaps. 
The visual symmetry of this particular layout is evident in many ways -- 
an unexpected bonus to its ergonomic effectiveness.

The common index finger home row heys with a physical bump out (bar or 
nipple) or indentation (scoop) have been replaced with regular dark grey 
keycaps instead. This feels much better to my index fingers, even if an 
initial glance is required to position the hands in their home row 
position.

[ljust]The **Space** bar and **Backspace** key are biege but look 
lighter from this angle due to their inverted position for a more 
natural thumb contact (as are left **Ctrl**, **Alt** and right **Fn** 
keys of the bottom row).

The contrasting home row keycaps also provide a visual reference point 
for the adjacent keys of multi-key combinations -- which have not yet 
been instilled in my touch typing memory. Similarly, I have alternating 
light grey keycaps in the number row for quicker visual reference -- 
most useful again for the (modifier combination) numeric function keys.

Why the use of blank keys and coloured keycaps? The Colemak Shift-DH 
layout moves several keys out of their QWERTY row positions. Unless you 
are using keycaps that have a uniformly flat profile such as DSA 
profile, shifting printed keys out of their row positions would impart 
physical changes to the row they land on. Also, even with a flat keycap 
profile, the modifier keys which cannot be swapped, would have incorrect 
legends. And the inverted bottom row keys would have upside-down 
legends! Besides, blank keycaps are just more aesthetic!

Armed with a keycap puller and more keycaps than most people have 
invested in their keyboards, there is no end of creative possibility!
