[ljust]just as I thought I was done, typing revealed one last(?) change!

Double tapping on the [number layer][maxed planck#number-layer] was 
a clever way to allow keying symbols that would have otherwise required 
either, shifting to the [symbol layer][maxed planck#symbol-layer] or 
adding a **Shift** modifier to the number layer.

Alternating layers is disruptive to typing flow. And, replacing one of 
the existing modifier assignments with the **Shift** key, given the 
modifier consistency across layers, is also undesirable. But there is 
a downside to double tapping on the number layer, as clever as it is: 
repeating digits is not that uncommon and efficient data entry easily 
triggers unintentional transformation of repeating digits to their 
corresponding double tap
symbols.

The solution? Another key assigned togglable layer was created! Leaving 
the existing modifiers untouched, the left pinkie toggles the 
corresponding symbol layer as defined below..

If the **Symbol** layer key had simply been defined as a **Shift** key 
instead, all of the shift symbols for the numbers **1** to **9** would 
have been easily available from the number layer. 

Choosing instead to map a corresponding symbol layer, however, allows 
adding the **Space**, **Comma**, **Semi-colon**, **Colon** and **Bar** 
characters for added convenience in entering lists of numbers. Of 
particular note, the **Space** key is not otherwise available to the 
number layer because the left thumb is already occupied toggling the 
layer itself, the **Space** key being assigned to right of the 
**Number** layer key as can be seen [here][thumb plancking].

This last change preserves what the original double tapping design 
provided, with even a few beneficial additions. This could be the final 
firmware flash..
