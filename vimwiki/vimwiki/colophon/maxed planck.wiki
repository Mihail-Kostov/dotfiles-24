no sooner said, than undone.. or at least revisited! Taking advantage of 
the QMK firmware, keys have been overloaded with complimentary modifier, 
one shot and double tap actions to increase the power of each layer. 

With redundant, albeit conveniently placed, modifiers accessible with 
the left and right hand pinkies, it did not take long to realize that 
these keys could instead be defined as multi-key modifiers, simplifying 
key chords immensely and providing a much broader set of modifier keys 
around the perimeter of the keyboard. Strangely, it takes a bit of 
getting used to, disengaging from the memorized finger contortions 
necessary for holding down common modifier key combinations. But, taking 
advantage of
the common chords used for desktop navigation and editing, it should be 
short order to adapt to the new and reduced fingering sequences.

The ease of defining [double tap keys][planck 
refactored#double-tap-keys] with the Planck keyboard, further allows 
extending the character set of each layer by overloading the keys, 
thereby, lessening the need to switch between the number and symbol 
layers, and favouring single hand entry. This is particularly useful for 
entering number values, and constructing [regular 
expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) during 
coding. While working with regular expressions precludes touch typing, 
due to the forethought that is necessary, not needing to alternate 
layers is advantageous and feels more fluid.. with practice.

Regardless, the firmware coding cost is minimal, so why not!

The following legends illustrate the Planck layers resulting from the 
application of this added functionality. Pink keys toggle layers and are 
shown as red keys while depressed. Cyan keys are one shot keys. Purple 
keys are double tap keys. Light green keys without legends inherit the 
defined key on the default Colemak layer. Blank light grey keys have no 
key action for the layer.

## default colemak layer

and modifier keys..

![Default Colemak layer](/images/keyboard-layout-default.jpg)

Modifiers when held down or depressed as one shot keys are available in 
left/right hand positions for ease of constructing multi-key chords. The 
multi-key pinkie modifiers **Shift-GUI**, **Shift-Alt**, **Ctrl-Alt** 
and **Ctrl-Shift**, along with one shot keys are particularly useful for 
simplifying complex key chords.

Double tapping the **Quote** inserts enclosing **Double Quote**'s.

## number layer

and double tap keys..

![Number layer](/images/keyboard-layout-number.jpg)

Double tap symbols to type numeric values such as hexadecimal color 
constants, dollar amounts, percentages, binary values, etc. Numeric 
arrays and lists are easily entered without needing to switch layers.

Normalizing the common key pairs between the number and symbol layers, 
and the default Colemak layer, eases finger memory. The familiar numeric 
keypad layout (with the uniquely added hexadecimal extension) is easily 
adapted to without effort.

## symbol layer

and double tap and one shot modifier keys..

![Symbol layer](/images/keyboard-layout-symbol.jpg)

Double tap symbols and numbers to construct regular expressions for 
programming and text manipulation. I seldom define more than three regex 
substitution groups (referenced by **Backslash** **Digit**), six should 
be plenty!

Combine one shot modifier keys to construct function key chords -- left 
pinkie multi-key modifiers further simplify chording. Mirroring the 
numeric keypad for the symbol layer layout all but eliminates the 
learning curve for the left hand. Pretty sweet.

## navigation layer

and one shot modifier keys..

![Navigation layer](/images/keyboard-layout-navigation.jpg)

Combine one shot modifier keys to press navigation key chords. Note the 
**Caps Lock** key which, separate from the default Colemak layer, 
prevents accidental toggling, yet is still easily enabled. Besides, 
SHOUTING is not good messaging etiquette :-)

The **Adjust** key, safely tucked away on the navigation layer, raises 
the Planck configuration layer which assigns the default layout, sets 
LED and audio levels, and resets the keyboard for reflashing the 
firmware. 

## plover layer

learn steno!..

![Plover layer](/images/keyboard-layout-plover.jpg)

With the exception of the steep learning curve required to master 
stenographic (chord based) typing with the Plover layer, the layers 
provided for regular typing are remarkably easy to use. 

No lengthy finger memory training required as the number layer keypad, 
and its mirrored counterpart for the symbol layer, feel both familiar 
and natural. And the use of double tap keys on those layers to extend 
single hand entry while on those layers furthers the advantage of this 
diminutive keyboard over its full sized relatives, not to mention the 
immense benefits of its finger friendly symmetrical layout over the 
pervasive staggered keyboards.

Planck Ortholinear plus QMK rules!
