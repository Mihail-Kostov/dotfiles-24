converting to [rofi][] from dmenu, it turns out, proved to be just the 
beginning. Its extended dmenu feature set refocused attention on the 
format possibilities of the menu content -- not that there was anything 
dmenu restricted.

But [ricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/index) has its own 
lure..

## columnar output

[column](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/column.1.html) is a text 
formatting tool that space aligns text. This is facilitated by inserting 
a separator character into the menu content -- of course, the 
[dmenu functions][rofi#dmenu] must also accommodate these new **Space** 
formatted lines..

`selection=$(... \`
`^          | ... \`
`^          | column -s\^^ -t \`
`^          | ... \`
`^          | dmenu "Prompt..." -no-custom) || exit`

[ljust]where, the **caret** (^) character in this example is the column 
separator in the input list to dmenu a.k.a. [rofi][rofi#rofi].

## indenting

to add a bit of uniqueness to this rofi usage, the input lines are also 
indented below the prompt message. This adds a touch of readability to 
the minimalist presentation which omits the commonly used background 
colour highlight (I use full transparency)..

`INDENT='   '`
`fontsize=...`
`padding=...`
`...`
`dmenu() {`
`^  prompt=...`
`^  select=...`
`^  ...`
`^  input=$(sed "s/^/$INDENT/" \`
`^        | rofi -bg black -bc black -bw 0 -fg '#FDF6E3' -hlbg black -hlfg '#25C0EF' \`
`^               -font "PragmataPro $fontsize" -eh 2 \`
`^               -opacity 85 -separator-style none -hide-scrollbar \`
`^               -lines $lines -width 100 -fixed-num-lines -padding $padding \`
`^               -dmenu -p "$prompt──────   " -i -mesg ' ' -select "$select" $@ \`
`^        )`
`^  [ $? -eq 0 ] && echo "$input" | sed "s/^^$INDENT//" || return 1`
`}`

[ljust]Stripping the indent padding before returning the "result" makes 
for a seamless implementation. 

Together with columnar formatting of menu content (where applicable), 
readability and aesthetics are improved..

[ljust]Note: the menu list looks unsorted because this dmenu function 
prepends the normal sorted project file list with the *history* of 
previously selected items! 

Rofi. I use it a LOT and continually refine the rofi scripts to 
streamline my workflow. As per usual, the [dotfiles][] can be found 
[here](https://github.com/sdothum/dotfiles).
