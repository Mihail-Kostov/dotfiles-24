is a collection of disk monitoring tools which can inspect, test and, 
more importantly, monitor the health of your hard disks (and precious 
data) and notify you via your system notification mechanism or an email.

Strangely, when 
[smartmontools](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/smartmontools/wiki) is 
installed in Debian, it is not initially configured to actively monitor 
your hard disks. You have to enable device scanning in the 
/etc/smartd.conf file with..

`DEVICESCAN -d removable -n standby -m sdothum@gmail.com -M exec /usr/share/smartmontools/smartd-runner`

And configure an associated email template in your 
/etc/smartmontools/run.d/10mail file..

`#!/bin/bash -e`
`email=/etc/smartmontools/run.d/email`
`(cat <<EOF`
`To: $4`
`From: root@$(hostname)`
`Subject: $3`
`^ `
`$(cat $1)`
`EOF`
`) >$email`
`su -c "/usr/local/bin/msmtp-enqueue.sh --account=gmail -t <$email" shum`

I use msmtp in place of the usual sendmail -- something I configured for 
the mutt email client and retained for [Sup][sup] mail.
