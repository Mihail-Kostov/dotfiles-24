the standard [Colemak](https://colemak.com/) layout significantly 
improves upon the QWERTY layout. The Colemak community further refined 
the Colemak layout with..

## colemak dh

addressing the **DH** placement, **D** for its letter frequency and 
**H** for the *HE* bigram, whilst retaining **ZXCV** on the bottom row..

## colemak xv

further optimizes the layout placement of the higher frequency **BMV** 
for smaller hands, albeit sacrificing the QWERTY/Colemak **ZXCV** 
cluster..

![Colemak Mod-XV](/images/keyboard-layout-colemak-xvdh.jpg) 

The **MK** swap is already recommended for ortholinear keyboards on the Colemak
Mod-DH site.

**Z** and **J**, the least frequent English letters, now occupy the most
difficult to reach key positions. **V**, more frequent than **X**, is more
easily reached with the ring finger. Other factors determine the placement of
the **B** but it is still in a more optimal position than before. 

The end result is the least common English letters are now placed in the outer
corner reaches for each hand.

## colemak cg

is a purely English language optimized layout, swapping the **CF** and **GP**
key pairs for a marginal improvement in finger travel and comfort..

![Colemak Mod-CG](/images/keyboard-layout-colemak-qwcg.jpg) 

The higher frequency letters **C** and **G** now occupy the top row for arguably
better placement. Initial usage seems to bear this out despite the finger memory
hurdle for these more common letters (than the *XV-Mod* above) -- a good sign.
There are new finger rolls to learn and, whether these are cumulatively better,
remains to be seen. 

The swapped letter frequency differences are not huge. But the **CF** swap does
feel like a definite improvement. The **GP** swap is close to being a wash --
though, overcoming finger memory of this particular pair is required before
final judgment. 

The final tally of key swaps (arrow legend) from the original Colemak layout now
stand at..

![Colemak Deviation](/images/keyboard-layout-colemak-deviation.jpg)

As can be seen, this is far removed from the original Colemak specification (top
legend) and the minor but effective *Mod-DH* variant (bottom legend -- which
I highly recommend, if none other). The **B** and **K** keys are returned to
their original Colemak assignments from the *Mod-DH* layout -- as a natural
progression in the development of this layout.

Having arrived at the *CG-Mod* (for lack of a better name) in the search for the
optimal layout for these hands, typing with it feels like an improvement,
however subtle -- plus, it's easily implemented on my [Planck][planck constant]
keyboards which makes it an effortless transition across all my computers. 

Time will tell whether I stick with the *CG-Mod* or revert to the less radical
*XV-Mod*. At the very least, it is exercising new neural pathways..
