this site now uses the [Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main) HTTP server 
with the [Phusion Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/) 
application server. This simplifies the Nginx configuration 
considerably whilst adding the deployment benefits of Phusion Passenger, 
notably, being able to promote site wide enhancements without needing to 
restart the Nginx HTTP server.

Adding Phusion Passenger to an existing Ruby/Gems environment couldn't 
be simpler..

`gem install passenger`
`passenger-install-nginx-module`

This particular web site follows the default convention for deploying 
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) applications. The [Nginx 
proxy][nginx proxy] configuration is now reduced to..

`server {`
`^  listen 80;`
`^  server_name thedarnedestthing.com;`
`^  root /srv/www/thedarnedestthing.com/application/public;`
`^  passenger_enabled on;`
`}`

The only oddity along the way I discovered with the migration to Phusion 
Passenger was that inline [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/) HTML templates 
no longer appeared to work and required that template specifications 
reside in the standard _application/views_ folder. Not a bad thing, but 
it did have me scratching my head for awhile.
