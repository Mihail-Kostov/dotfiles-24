the web with all its metadata about itself is an interesting analogue of
the mind, hence, its inclusion. Much of the content in this thread is 
merely notes concerning the Linux builds I use -- memory aids for 
problems that may recur on subsequent builds.

For the curious, this site is built with
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and the
[Nginx](http://wiki.nginx.org/Main) HTTP server with [Phusion
Passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/).

On a remote server, [offlineimap](http://offlineimap.org/) and
[imapfilter](https://github.com/lefcha/imapfilter/) processes, along
with Ruby parsing scripts, manage and update [comment][comments]
responses to this site's content and update this server with the comment
snippets minus the email headers.

The content itself is, quite simply, written using the [vim][grokking 
vim] text editor with the [vimwiki](http://code.google.com/p/vimwiki/) 
bundle. vimwiki creates a database of plain text files with 
corresponding topic file names. These raw files are referenced by the 
Sinatra web site application -- vimwiki's markup syntax is tranformed to 
[kramdown](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/) markup, and the 
[Slim](http://slim-lang.com/) template engine and 
[CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) take care of the 
rest.

It sounds more complicated than it is. See the [brief history][] and 
[current configuration][] of this site to get the gist of this 
circuitous story.
