the [Colemak Shift-DH][colemak shift-dh] introduced left/right hand 
diagonal 
fingering symmetry which alleviates the left hand wrist twist of most keyboard layouts.

Lately, I have been playing with optimizing the keyboard experience by 
changing the keycap orientation and layout to minimize finger movement 
and improve hand position even more!

Three things were done to my original Poker 2 fitted with Cherry profile 
keycaps and my Colemak Shift-DH layout..

- The R2 row was replaced by R4 row keycaps, rotated 180 degrees
- Similarly, the top R1 row is rotated 180 degrees
- The left hand position is shifted back out one key to the left (as in 
  a typical layout) with my Colemak Shift-DH layout **equal**, 
  **minus**, **slash** and **backslash** keys moved the vacated row 
  positions
  
The key rotation of the Cherry profile keycaps effectively forms 
a concave side profile to the keyboard, further minimizing finger reach. 
It is very noticeable. Using blank keycaps makes this very easy to 
implement. If you are short R4 keycaps, you can swap the R2 keycaps with 
the R4 row instead for a close approximation.

This results in a keyboard profile, top to bottom, with..

- Rotated R1
- Rotated R4
- R3
- R4 (or swapped R2)
- Rotated R4 (space bar and modifier keys)

[ljust]My space bar row already had the keycaps rotated 180 degrees. 
This most notibly improves thumb contact feel.

The shifting of the left side special characters, while losing easy 
pinky finger reach, further separates the left hand from the right. It 
is only an additional 1U key width separation but again, is a very 
noticeable improvement in hand and arm positioning. It does impose an 
index finger stretch to reach the special characters but their low 
frequency usage offsets the inconvenience -- whilst gaining pinky key 
access to my more frequently used **Esc** key.

<code>    `~  1 2 3 4 5 6   7 8 9 0 = [  ]</code>
`^    Esc  Q W F P B -   J L U Y ; '  Del`
`^     Tab  A R S T G /   M N E I O  Enter`
`^     Shift X C D V Z   \ K H , .  Shift`
<code>Ctrl  Win  Alt    Space    Backspace  Fn  Pn  Ctrl</code>

## ergonomics

not so strangely, is also somewhat subjective, not merely physics. 

After several days of typing with the layout above, I found the index 
finger stretch for the special characters felt more strained than the 
former pinky finger stretch to the **Esc**, **Tab** and **backslash** 
characters of my original Colemak Shift-DH layout -- that and the 
persistent pinky reach in particular for the **hyphen** and **slash** 
characters.

Leaving the number row in its usual positioning with the relocated 
**equal** sign, though, was easily adapted to and, in fact, even feels 
better to me -- aided by the particular color coding of my blank keycaps 
which now highlights the **equal** key -- probably because I was never 
a proficient number row typist (which should be rectified with my new 
Planck keyboard and the use of keyboard layers).

So, until my second Planck kit arrives, this is the latest hybridized 
layout I prefer..

<code>    `~  1 2 3 4 5 6   7 8 9 0 = [  ]</code>
`^    Esc  - Q W F P B   J L U Y ; '  Del`
`^     Tab  / A R S T G   M N E I O  Enter`
`^    \  Shift X C D V Z   K H , .  Shift`
<code>Ctrl  Win  Alt    Space    Backspace  Fn  Pn  Ctrl</code>
