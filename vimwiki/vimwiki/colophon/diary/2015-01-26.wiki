lots of minor tweaks have been made to the content and presentation of 
the colophon. Most notably, the code snippets are now, I hope, more 
legible and better formatted (in particular, line wrap is no longer by 
word for a clearer presentation). I still do not present code in the 
typical scrolling code box, largely because my preference is to be able 
to see all the code at a glance -- as it is, familiarity makes 
corrections difficult to catch and frequent typos would escape me if 
hidden from view.

The big new thing has been working with [herbstluftwm][]. Having 
referenced it in the [bspwm][] writeups but having never really taken it 
for a lengthy spin, I decided sooner rather than later to give it a good 
look.. despite my remarks after my [last bspwm writeup][bspwm 
framed#session-startup]. 

My workflow segued with herbstluftwm better than I could have imagined 
-- and it took less scripting (than bspwm) to do so. This is not a knock 
 against bspwm -- that window manager still rocks! But for now, I am 
 driving with herbstluftwm. Both herbstluftwm and bspwm's shell oriented
configurations have me sold, providing both ease and power.

As stated on the home page, it's now time to refocus on what this site 
was originally intended to serve..
