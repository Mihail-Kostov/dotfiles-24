the browser landscape has been somewhat active of late, with the demise 
of [dwb](http://portix.bitbucket.org/dwb/) (the author embarking on 
a new browser) and the entry of 
[qutebrowser](https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser) -- a PyQt 
Webkit browser not using the traditional WebKitGtk+ library -- and 
[lispkit](https://github.com/AeroNotix/lispkit). 
[Luakit](https://github.com/mason-larobina/luakit) has been my go to 
browser for some five years but has not seen much development the past 
few.

Fresh with the transition to [herbstluftwm][], [vimb][] caught my eye 
after giving qutebrowser a good spin for a couple weeks -- it's not 
quite there yet and will deserve another good look down the road. vimb 
is not without its limitations but its [vim-like][grokking vim] 
pedigree made it so easy to use and configure -- ridiculously simple for 
a vim user -- I've found myself using it.. a lot. 

It made me rethink my approach to a lot of my browser workflow -- in 
particular, my shortcuts. My configuration of vimb feels more seamless 
and concise 
-- all of which could be ported back to luakit or qutebrowser for 
 consistency 
 -- which is a testament to the design of vimb. If you like the modal 
  command environment of vim, then vimb may be your ticket as 
  a complementary browser.
