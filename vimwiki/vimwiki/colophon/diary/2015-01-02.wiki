it has been a meandering route to this place -- starting out as a proof 
of concept with shell scripts cobbled together to massage vimwiki text 
files into html, to Ruby scripts and then to a Ruby Sinatra web 
application. Hardware upgrades, water cooling, overclocking.. all made 
the journey interesting.

This section is as much a repository of notes about the system this site 
is built from as anything. It is my humble contribution back to the 
internet community which has served me at every turn when I have tripped 
over a technical problem -- both hardware and software. It is a constant 
source of learning.

There is still much to document. And to explore. The search for the 
ultimate user interface is a never ending personal one. Saving 
keystrokes may seem like a needless exercise but it's probably as close 
to any amount of "control" that is achievable -- which, ironically, is 
what this site set out to explore in the nature of our being.
