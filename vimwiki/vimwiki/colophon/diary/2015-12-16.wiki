over the months, many under the hood changes have been made to the 
development server.

Moving from zsh to dash for all shell scripts initiated a rethink of the 
standard way to organize scripts -- namely, to go from a typical *bin* 
directory containing every manner of user script to a directory 
hierarchy of scripts. This led to a wrapper/source function organization 
of scripts which percolated to the dmenu and herbstluftwm scripts, and 
the setting of the *PATH* environment variable as required.

herbstluftwm continues to be refined to my workflow and rofi replaced 
dmenu2 as the final global eye-candy change. Hot key menus playing such 
an important role in my workflow, the rofi fullscreen changeover brings 
the user interface altogether with pleasing effect (IMO).

As usual, the changes can be tracked in the 
[dotfiles](https://github.com/sdothum/dotfiles) while I attempt to 
document some of the more interesting aspects.
