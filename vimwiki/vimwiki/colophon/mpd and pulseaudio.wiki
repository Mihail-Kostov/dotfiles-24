[mpd](http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon_Wiki) is a great 
music player daemon, especially when used with the 
[ncmpcpp](http://ncmpcpp.rybczak.net/screenshots.php) client. By 
default, mpd is installed under user mpd which prevents playing 
simutaneous audio streams within 
[PulseAudio](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio).

To enable playing multiple concurrent audio streams with 
PulseAudio..

`cp /etc/mpd.conf ~/.mpdconf`

And edit the following in ~/.mpdconf..

`music_directory         "/net/media/music"`
`playlist_directory      "~/.mpd/playlists"`
`db_file                 "~/.mpd/tag_cache"`
`log_file                "~/tmp/mpd.log"`
`pid_file                "~/.mpd/pid"`
`state_file              "~/.mpd/state"`
`sticker_file            "~/.mpd/sticker.sql"`
`#user                   "mpd"   # default to current user`
`auto_update             "yes"`
`follow_outside_symlinks "yes"`
`follow_inside_symlinks  "yes"`
`audio_output {`
`^    type                "pulse"`
`^    name                "My MPD PulseAudio Output"`
`}`

Disable the mpd systemd (or corresponding init.d) service and launch 
locally for the user with..

`# sudo /etc/init.d/mpd stop`
`# sudo update-rc.d -f mpd remove`
`sudo systemctl stop mpd.service`
`sudo systemctl disable mpd.service`
`mpd &`
