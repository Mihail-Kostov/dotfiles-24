removable devices on many desktop systems is facilitated by the 
[Thunar](http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start) file manager (and 
Thunar volume manager) with the 
[GVFS](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/gvfs) virtual filesystem. If 
Thunar is running, then any removable devices plugged in are 
automounted. And that is the snag: Thunar must be running in order for 
the device to be made available to other applications (unless they are 
capable of mounting the device themselves). For users of stacking window 
managers (mouse driven GUI desktops) this is largely a non-issue as 
Thunar or a similarly equipped file manager is likely the most common 
application launched to access the media.

Enter [udiskie](https://github.com/coldfix/udiskie), a storage device 
manager for handling removable media. It can be invoked within the 
.xinitrc or autostart script as..

`udiskie --use-udisks2`

The volume will be automounted on "/run/media/$USER/{partition label}" 
and be available to any application. When done accessing the device, you 
can simply remove the media to automatically unmount it.

Easy peasy.
