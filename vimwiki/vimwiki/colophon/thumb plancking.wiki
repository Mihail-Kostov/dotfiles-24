[ljust]changes to my Plancks are incremental now. Without a totally 
different layout approach, it would be difficult to cram much more key 
overloading to the [basic layout][maxed planck] I arrived at.

That being said, I did manage to implement a small but ergonomic 
application. The **Escape** and **Enter** keys previously resided on the 
home row -- common for the **Enter** key on ANSI keyboards..

The **Enter** key with correspondingly reassigned **CapsLock** key on 
the home row has been entrenched in all my previous Colemak layout 
incarnations. However, with my use of blank keycaps -- not needing 
legends for touch typing -- those highlighted keys stood separate from 
the modifier keys and begged to be moved closer -- not that the keycap 
colour needs to be bound to the underlying keystroke value.

Swapping those keys with the **Minus** and **Slash** keys was easy 
enough and made those keys feel more accessible with less of a pinkie 
stretch to press. The **Escape** and **Enter** keys now resided in what 
would typically be the **Shift** key positions.

The **Shift** key positions are familiar enough to typists but I have 
long since abandoned them with the Planck. And my pinkies, surprisingly, 
had gotten lazy over that period of time not needing to be used for 
*shifting* keys. This was born out during the 
[Amphetype](https://code.google.com/archive/p/amphetype) typing 
exercises I used to test the new layout..

It wouldn't have taken long to reestablish the once familiar pinkie 
finger reach but it occured on me that, for programming and editing 
where the **Escape** and **Enter** keys are used frequently, that 
relocating them to the modifier row might be better.

So, swapping these keys one further with the lesser used **Tab** and 
**Delete** keys on the modifier row does just that. The thumbs facilely 
press the **Escape**, **Space**, **Backspace** and **Enter** keys, the 
**Tab** and **Delete** keys are still easily accessible with the 
pinkies, and the **Minus** and **Slash** keys are now in better typing
positions. Win, win..

The ease with which this new layout has been adapted to is a good 
indicator. And the [other layers][maxed planck#number-layer] remain 
unaffected. Other ergonomic keyboards, notably split keyboards, often 
assign similar
keys to the thumb. I can now see why.
