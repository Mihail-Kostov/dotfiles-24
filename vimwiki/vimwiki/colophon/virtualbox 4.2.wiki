as of this writing, has not been merged into the official Debian 
repositories but is required if you want to run Windows 8, which the 
"guest additions" for, are still somewhat short of full OpenGL video 
support which prevents usage of some applications like Nik HDR Pro 2 and 
Color Efex Pro 4 photo software (which need to be able to identify 
specific video cards, unfortunately).

Not being available through the Debian repositories, there can be a 
problem with the virtualbox USB initialization for guest OS access. The 
script /usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxCreateUSBNode.sh cannot be found by 
udev on my LVM configuration because the /usr filesystem is not yet 
mounted. To circumvent this startup error so the shell script is visible 
from the root filesystem at boot..

`cp /usr/share/virtualbox/VBoxCreateUSBNode.sh /root`
`umount /usr/local`
`umount /usr`
`mkdir -p /usr/share/virtualbox`
`mv /root/VBoxCreateUSBNode.sh /usr/share/virtualbox/`

Another irritant is that the vboxdrv module appears not to load at boot 
which then requires the following to be executed prior to launching a 
guest OS for the first time..

`/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup`

To avoid this after every reboot..

`echo >>/etc/modules         # ensure a linefeed terminates file`
`echo vboxdrv >>/etc/modules`
