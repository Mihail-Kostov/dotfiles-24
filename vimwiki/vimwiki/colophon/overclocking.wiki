Gigabyte GA-EX58A-UD5 motherboard with 3.2Ghz Intel i7-930 -- dated 
hardware with still some kick in it -- with G.Skill 2133Mhz Ares memory. 
Water cooling setup permitted lazy (auto voltage) overclocking within 
thermal limits i.e. CPU core temperatures well below 100C under full 
load.

@ 4.00Ghz/4.16Ghz (turbo), memory @ 2000Mhz..
