seem like an unlikely topic. You have to be a somewhat of a "geek" to care 
about the subject. Most keyboards come with inexpensive ABS keycaps 
which are prone to wear over time -- sometimes showing wear within 
months. PBT and POM plastics are more expensive to produce and are 
a much denser material which impart a more "solid" feel to the keyboard.

A recent "group buy" at [Geekhack](http://geekhack.com) allowed me to 
sample PBT caps from another vendor, Gateron. My existing [Poker 
2][poker 2] keyboard came with Vortex OEM profile PBT caps which I later 
replaced with a set of Vortex Cherry profile blank PBT's.

The Gateron Cherry profile keycaps were available in four colours of 
which I purchased dark gray, light gray and beige -- white being to 
bright for my tastes. The dark gray Gateron contrasted to the Vortex 
dark gray was much grayer to the Vortex's near black colour. The light 
gray looked more like a dark beige, especially when matched with the 
beige set.

Waiting for the order to complete, whose process took two months from 
the announcement of the group buy, I originally planned to use three 
colours to create a layout with some visual cues for those key 
combinations that occasionally required a glance at the keyboard. I came 
up with this..

<code>^ ^ ^ ^ <span class='blue'>`~ ^ =</span> <span class='brown'>1 2 3 4 5 6 ^ ^ 7 8 9 0</span> <span class='blue'>[^ ^ ]</span></code>
<code>^ ^ ^ ^ Esc^ ^ <span class='blue'>-</span> <span class='brown'>Q W F P B ^ ^ J L U Y</span> <span class='blue'>; '</span>^ ^ Del</code>
<code>^ ^ ^ ^  Tab^ ^ <span class='blue'>/</span> <span class='brown'>A R S</span> T <span class='brown'>G ^ ^ M</span> N <span class='brown'>E I O</span>^ ^ Enter</code>
<code>^ ^ ^ ^ <span class='blue'>\</span>^ ^ Shift <span class='brown'>X V D C Z ^ ^ K H</span> <span class='blue'>, .</span>^ ^ Shift</code>
<code>Ctrl^ ^ Win^ ^ Alt^ ^ ^  <span class='blue'>Space^ ^ ^  Backspace</span>^ ^ Fn^ ^ Pn^ ^ Ctrl</code>

Using three colours allowed delineating the alphanumeric, special 
character and modifier key regions of the keyboard but at the cost of 
being somewhat noisy, possibly due to the contrast of the dark gray 
keycaps with the other two colours -- even with the dark gray Vortex, 
dark gray and light gray Gateron's and the dark gray, light gray and 
beige Gateron color combinations. 

The symmetry of the [Colemak Shift-DH][colemak shift-dh] layout, 
however, did lend itself to a two toned colour layout which was 
sufficiently informative but more aesthetically pleasing (pour moi). 
Using light gray (which looks like dark beige in contrast) for 
alphanumeric and beige for special character and modifier keys, creates 
a quiet two toned keyboard layout..

<code>^ ^ ^ ^ <span class='blue'>`~ ^ =</span> <span class='brown'>1 2 3 4 5 6 ^ ^ 7 8 9 0</span> <span class='blue'>[^ ^ ]</span></code>
<code>^ ^ ^ ^ <span class='blue'>Esc^ ^ -</span> <span class='brown'>Q W F P B ^ ^ J L U Y</span> <span class='blue'>; '^ ^ Del</span></code>
<code>^ ^ ^ ^  <span class='blue'>Tab^ ^ /</span> <span class='brown'>A R S</span> <span class='blue'>T</span> <span class='brown'>G ^ ^ M</span> <span class='blue'>N</span> <span class='brown'>E I O</span>^ ^ <span class='blue'>Enter</span></code>
<code>^ ^ ^ ^ <span class='blue'>\^ ^ Shift</span> <span class='brown'>X V D C Z ^ ^ K H</span> <span class='blue'>, .^ ^ Shift</span></code>
<code><span class='blue'>Ctrl^ ^ Win^ ^ Alt</span>^ ^ ^  <span 
class='brown'>Space^ ^ ^  Backspace</span>^ ^ <span class='blue'>Fn^ ^ Pn^ ^ Ctrl</span></code>

Highlighting the index finger home row keys -- versus using the common 
"raised" bar or scoop **F** and **J** keys --
completed the layout with an additional visual reference point for 
adjacent keys, especially the right shifted number row. While the 
**Backspace** key colour is usually the same as the modifier keys in 
typical ANSI layouts, matching it to the 
**Space** bar as its counterpoint looked better, in this case, to 
 separate it from the modifier keys of the bottom row.
 
After using the subdued combination of Gateron light grey and biege 
keycaps for several weeks, I reverted to trying the biege with dark grey 
keycaps for a high contrast layout. I left off the O-rings this time 
and, to my surprise, quite liked the new feel and sound -- perhaps the 
result of focusing on developing a light touch with the Cherry Reds. 
Newness probably plays a lot into this but, for now, it's a keeper 
combination.

The Gateron Cherry profile keycaps sit ever so slightly higher on their 
Cherry switches than the Vortex Cherry profile keycaps. But more 
importantly, their slightly fatter finger pads (tops) than the Vortex 
Cherry profile keycaps, feel even better in use.

My keyboard tweaking is done.. unless a rumoured set of Gateron Cherry 
profile jelly POM keycaps becomes available through yet another group 
buy! Like a good bed, investing in keyboard ergonomics pays dividends 
when you spend countless hours writing and coding.
