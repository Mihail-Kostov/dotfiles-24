before there was [mutt](http://www.mutt.org/), the email client that 
"sucked less". However, after discovering [Sup 
mail](http://supmua.org/), yet another 
[curses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) based (plain text) 
terminal application, there was no turning back. With 
[IMAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imap) 
[Maildir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir) labeling, combined with 
incoming inbox or archive assignment, and intelligent Gmail conversation 
threading, it is email consumption as it should be for distraction free 
management of large volumes of mail (yes, I subscribe to too many 
lists..).

Sup doesn't [gem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems) install easily 
on [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) because [Xapian](http://xapian.org/) 
is a gem install requirement -- and it is already part of the Debian 
core install, hence, the conflict when the gem install of Xapian is 
attempted. Fortunately, there is a Debian package for Sup to satisfy its 
dependencies. Unfortunately, it is built from the master branch which 
does not provide IMAP Maildir sync.

As I use [OfflineImap](http://offlineimap.org/) and 
[IMAPFilter](https://github.com/lefcha/imapfilter/) extensively for 
managing my IMAP accounts across all my computers, I copy the Sup 
development fork from [Edward 
Yang](http://gitorious.org/~ezyang/sup/ezyang/commits/maildir-sync/) to 
provide IMAP Maildir sync. A very minor patch is required to util.rb 
which, quite likely, is a Debian/[RVM](https://rvm.io/) rubygems issue 
specific to my system..

`sed -i '1i\`
`require "iconv"' util.rb`

To run the Sup fork with the sources copied to the /opt/sup/ directory..

`ruby -I/opt/sup/lib /opt/sup/bin/sup`

And when using RVM1.9.1..

`ruby -I/opt/sup/lib -I/usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1/x86_64-linux -I/usr/lib/ruby/1.9.1 /opt/sup/bin/sup`
