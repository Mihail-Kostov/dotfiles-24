finally! The configuration files for the applications discussed on this 
site are now available at [github](https://github.com/sdothum/dotfiles).

Like much of the [[colophon]] material, expect frequent updates as 
configurations and scripts are fine tuned.. and I hem and haw about what 
might be of interest to the community at large.

I use [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for managing the
configurations of common applications installed across my system. It not 
only enables organizing configuration files under a single root folder, 
it also provides a map of the various paths used by an application which 
can be listed with..

`tree ~/dotfiles/application # or ls -lr ~/dotfiles/application`

[ljust]which often include files in _$HOME, ~/.config, ~/.local/share_ 
etc.

Using [Syncthing](http://syncthing.net/), it is easy to synchronize 
these configuration files across machines in real time (well, almost, 
with little time lag) by simply syncing the root _stow_ (dotfiles) 
directory on each machine. 

Of course, regular snapshots are in order, to recover from that 
unfortunate edit or file pruning of content within the stow repository 
(as Syncthing will, more often than not, promote the unintended change 
before it can be caught)!
