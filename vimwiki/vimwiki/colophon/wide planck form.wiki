just when you think you're done, there is always another idea to try 
out! The [Colemak 
forum](https://forum.colemak.com/topic/2158-dreymars-big-bag-of-keyboard-tricks-usb2usb-edition/) 
has long advocated a wide or extended key layout to further enhance the 
ergonomics of the Colemak layout by remapping the keys such that the 
left and right hand positions are shifted out by one column. Using a 60% 
keyboard and radically left shifting the whole layout one column to 
achieve [left and right hand fingering symmetry][shift-mod layout] did 
not permit increasing the left and right hand separation.

All my previous [Planck 
posts](http://thedarnedestthing.com/search?query=planck) reflected 
variations on my particular Colemak Shift-DH mod. A recent poster 
soliciting reviews of his proposed wide QWERTY layout inspired 
revisiting the idea. The 40% Planck in a conventional layout provides 
for a single pinkie and index finger extension -- very symmetrical and 
ergonomic.

By remapping the outer key assignments and shifting the logical halves 
of the layout one column towards the edges of the keyboard, eliminating 
any pinkie finger extension, each index finger inherits a double column 
reach
in the middle of the keyboard -- more than even the wide Colemak mod 
above -- which, I have always been reluctant to do.

However, reducing the range of the generally weaker pinkie finger at the 
expense of increasing the stretch for the stronger index finger does 
garner a significant benefit. Namely, increasing hand separation and, 
thus, the geometry of one's arms and shoulders and, more importantly, 
wrist angle. This is very tangibly noticeable and superior.

## wide colemak

the inserted double middle column has been assigned lesser used symbols 
and punctuation. Row assignments and even the set of characters may 
change (not unsurprisingly, given my history) during usage..

layout](/images/keyboard-layout-stretch-colemak.jpg)

[ljust]The cursor cluster is altered by the shift of the thumb *symbol 
layer* key. The arrangement is unorthodox but works sufficiently for me. 
Time will tell. The arrangement makes the **Left** / **Right** cursor 
pairing available to the *number layer*.

The prior pinkie **Tab** and **Delete** keys have now been displaced to 
the central column which are, surprisingly, much easier to reach and use 
with the thumbs. There is no overloading that digit. Note the double tap 
**Double Quote** key. It's the little details of the Planck!

## number layer

left shifting the numerc keypad to align it with the natural split of 
the layout does cause a bit of a mashup of the hexadecimal characters 
with the numeric fingering that I impose. Not a big issue for the 
frequency of hexadecimal input I require..

![Stretch numeric layout](/images/keyboard-layout-stretch-numeric.jpg)

A second numeric layer is available for the right hand with the 
associated number symbols and a few others for convenience of input. 
Using a layer rather than double tapping prevents inadvertent key 
conversion during rapid data entry.

## symbol layer

the symbol layer deviates the most from my [previous design][maxed 
planck#symbol-layer] with the addition of a secondary layer (and regex 
symbols) versus over usage of double tap key assignments -- again, to 
prevent inadvertent key conversion during rapid typing, which isn't 
typical while composing complex regular expressions but nevertheless..

![Stretch symbol layout](/images/keyboard-layout-stretch-symbol.jpg)

Removed are the dedicated combination modifiers for the left hand to 
facilitate the shift. They are not required for my particular desktop 
environment on this layer, so no inconvenience.

## navigation layer

the navigation layer is just shifted relative to the thumb keys that 
raise the layer..

layout](/images/keyboard-layout-stretch-navigation.jpg)

## plover layer

the Plover layer only gains a one column shift..

## transition

thus far, the transition has been surprisingly easy. Some finger memory 
needs be developed for the index finger extensions, but the superior 
hand position, is probably worthwhile in the long run. The pinkies 
certainly are well rested!

The only perceptible annoyance that needs to be addressed is the 
occasional unexpected keyboard action that results from the now 
increased usage of the outer columns -- essentially the **A** and **O** 
keys -- which are also defined as [compound modifiers][wide planck 
form]. These modifiers are very useful for issuing window manager 
navigation key chords -- being one to eschew using mice. 

Some tuning of the Planck firmware is in order or perhaps extending the 
navigation layer to provide window manager control! Or simply removing 
the modifier assignment for those two frequently used keys..
