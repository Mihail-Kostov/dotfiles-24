# dotfiles

These are the dotfiles referenced in
[the darnedest thing](http://thedarnedestthing.com/colophon), and then
some.

## warning

At the time of this README, vimb has become my browser of choice. As 
such, I have not continued to maintain this luakit configuration. 

However, as luakit development ceased well before I stopped using it as 
my main browser, this configuration should still work.

## caveats

Many of the configuration files contain custom keybind specifications. 
Note that these are tailored for the
Colemake Shift-DH layout -- a custom Colemak variant -- described in the
reference url above and use vim mappings (customized) where possible. Redefine these keybinds as required.
